# UMTSM C++ Examples

Examples of Generating State Machines in C++

This repository contains example projects that demonstrate how to generate and work with state machines using **UMTSM**, a proprietary, UML-based state machine definition tool. UMTSM allows developers to define state machines using its own modeling language and generate source code in multiple programming languages and frameworks.

These examples focus on **C++ language** and illustrate how to model, generate, and execute state machines with UMTSM.

## Project Structure

Each example resides in its own directory. Some examples are further divided into multiple "cases", each demonstrating different states or behaviors, organized in subdirectories.

A typical example includes two main directories:

- **`src/`**
  Contains manually written code. In particular:
  - `src/main/` includes the C++ `main()` function, which initializes and runs the state machines.
  - Other subdirectories contain:
    - `.umt` files, which define the state machines.
    - Function files that implement behaviors required by the state machines — these must be implemented by the developer.

- **`generated/`**
  Contains code automatically generated by **UMTSM** and the **CppGen** code generator for the C++ language.
  - `generated/src/` includes generated C++ code for the state machines.
  - `generated/test/` contains auto-generated C++ test files using **gTest/gMock**, also produced by CppGen.

Build configuration files (`CMakeLists.txt`) required to compile the examples are generated by UMTSM and CppGen. Dependencies between state machines and external libraries are handled via helper scripts such as `CmakeExtras.cmake`.

## Included Examples

The repository includes the following sample applications:

- **01-paroot** — Solves parabolic equations
  - `case-0`: A classical approach before introducing state machines. 
  - `case-1`: The basic state machine modeling converted from _case-0_.
  - `case-2`: Detailed state machine model of the problem.

- **02-numberguess** — A number guessing game (between 1 and 99)
  - `case-1`: Computer takes a number between 1 and 99 and the player guess it.
  - `case-2`: The improved version of the _case-1_. The player can be drow, cancel the game any time.
  - `case-3`: The improved version of _case-2_. Computer applies some time box to enter a guees and complete the game. 

- **03-keypress** — Tracks and sorts pressed keys

- **04-calculator** — A simple four-function calculator

- **05-crossroad** — Manages a four-lane junction and pedestrian crossings in both controlled and uncontrolled modes

- **06-timewatch** — A stopwatch application that tracks elapsed time

- **07-door** — A door application that simulates an door in automatic and manual modes.
  - `case-1`: The manualy operated door example.
  - `case-2`: The automatical operated door example. The door is closed after given a time passed.
  - `case-3`: The complete example for door that can be switched between manual and automatic modes.
